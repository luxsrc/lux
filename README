lux: a high performance scientific computation framework
--------------------------------------------------------

  lux is a software framework that helps people develop portable high
  performance scientific computation software.  It is designed around
  a simple but powerful module architecture.  Everything in lux is
  implemented as a module.  The lux core library, libux, provides
  basic functions to access modules/plug-ins and to construct,
  configure, and run scientific computation jobs.

FOR USERS: for people we are interested in using lux to build their
  own software, please download a distribution tarballs, e.g.,
  lux-0.2.tar.gz, from GitHub's release page:

	https://github.com/luxsrc/lux/releases

  These tarballs were created by using `make distcheck` and passed all
  built-in checks in lux.  Users can simply follow the standard

	./configure && make && make install

  chain to configure, build, and install lux just like any other
  standard GNU packages.  Details installation instructions can be
  found in the "INSTALL" file that comes with the tarball.

  If any of the "AUTHORS", "ChangeLog", "INSTALL", "NEWS", or
  "configure" files is missing, then it is very likely that you
  obtained lux by using git.  In such a case, please redownload a
  distribution tarballs as described above, or use autotools to
  bootstrap the package as describe below.

FOR DEVELOPERS: for people we are interested in contributing to lux,
  please fork the lux's git repository on GitHub:

	https://github.com/luxsrc/lux

  work on your fork, and then create pull request to merge your
  changes back to the main repository.

  lux's git repository only tracks human generate source codes.
  Automatically generated files such as "AUTHORS", "ChangeLog",
  "INSTALL", "NEWS", and "configure" are not tracked.  Therefore, it
  must be first bootstrapped before it can be used.

  Bootstrapping requires autoconf 2.64+, automake 1.11.6+, and libtool
  2.2.10+.  Once these autotools are available on the system,

	./bootstrap

  would run autotools through lux and generate the "configure" file.
  You may then use the standard `./configure && make && make install`
  chain to configure, build, and install lux as described above.
