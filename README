`lux`: a High Performance Distributed Computing Framework
=========================================================

`lux` is a framework for developing portable high performance
scientific computing software.

Based on a generic performance model, `lux` provides resources and
task abstractions to support run time optimization.
It manages resources, measures task performance, and then dynamically
adjusts algorithms to achieve portable performance for distributed
heterogeneous systems.

Using a simple module architecture, `lux` provides basic functions to
access modules/plug-ins and supports configuring, planning, and
running scientific computing jobs.
Almost everything in `lux` is implemented as a module.
This makes `lux` lightweight but powerful.
