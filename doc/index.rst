``lux`` Documentation
#####################

``lux`` is a framework for developing portable high performance
scientific computing software.

Based on a generic performance model, ``lux`` provides resources and
task abstractions to support run time optimization.
It manages resources, measures task performance, and then dynamically
adjusts algorithms to achieve portable performance for distributed
heterogeneous systems.

Using a simple module architecture, ``lux`` provides basic functions
to access modules/plug-ins and supports configuring, planning, and
running scientific computing jobs.
Almost everything in ``lux`` is implemented as a module.
This makes ``lux`` lightweight but powerful.
